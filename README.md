## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

*** I decided against mobile view as I am only 1 month into my journey and want to feel comfortable using HTML/CSS to make these sites before I start messing with mobile view as I want to get a sound understanding of one before the other.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

During this task I learned a more indepth understand of CSS Grid and flexbox to work with them along side to achieve the goals.

I also learned how to use Transition/Transform to make the site more responsive by simply reading others code and googling how to achieve the result so I am proud that I have been able to take my knowledge and apply it to an off-platform site.

### Continued development

I am going to continue to do these smaller, less stressful projects to ensure my knowledge with layouts and CSS become more embedded into my brain, whilst also trying new things on each project eventually learning how to achieve a perfect mobile view.
